.SH NAME
simple_shell \- a simple UNIX command language interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a command line interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file. It is a custom implementation of the UNIX shell, designed to mimic the basic functionality of the \fBsh\fR shell.

The shell runs in an infinite loop, performing the following actions:
.RS
1. Displays a prompt (interactive mode only).
.br
2. Reads a line of input from the user.
.br
3. Parses the line into a command and arguments.
.br
4. Looks for the command in the current directory or the \fBPATH\fR.
.br
5. Creates a child process to execute the command.
.br
6. Waits for the command to finish and prints the prompt again.
.RE

.SH INVOCATION
.B simple_shell
can be invoked in two modes:

.B Interactive Mode:
.br
When invoked without arguments and connected to a terminal, the shell displays a prompt \fB($)\fR and waits for user input.
.br
Example:
.br
$ ./hsh
.br
($) ls -l

.B Non-Interactive Mode:
.br
If standard input is piped into the shell, or if a stream is provided, no prompt is displayed.
.br
Example:
.br
$ echo "ls" | ./hsh

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
The shell supports the following built-in commands:

.TP
.B exit
Exits the shell. The status of the last executed command is returned.

.TP
.B env
Prints the current environment variables to standard output.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

.br
$ ./hsh
.br
($) ls
